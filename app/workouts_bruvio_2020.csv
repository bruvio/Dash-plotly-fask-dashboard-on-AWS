"FD - Forza Dinamica - fuori sella ( 3 serie)","Bike","Le Ripetizioni di forza Dinamica (FD) Servono per abituare l'organismo a sforzi violenti a partire da diverse condizioni (pianura, salita, rapporto agile e rapporto duro). L'analisi dei tracciati di gara ha mostrato che anche in gare considerate performance ad intensità costante, come le cronometro, in realtà sono costellate da una moltitudine di brevi impulsi ad alto impegno di forza (in gare lunghe tipo IM e GF si sono contati fino a 200 di questi episodi!!). Non allenare queste espressioni di forza significa trovarsi in una condizione sfavorevole nel fine gara che impedisce di finalizzare una gara di ciclismo o di correre al meglio la maratona, nel caso dell'Ironman. La parte centrale dell'allenamento è costituita da tre serie costituite da 5 ripetizioni da 10"", ad ogni ripetizione si recupera 1', mentre al termine di ogni serie si recupera 3'. Le ripetute vanno eseguite in piedi suoi pedali. Come se eseguono: L'esecuzione prevede che si raggiungano le massime RPM e di conseguenza la massima potenzza consentite dal rapporto indicato, nel tempo indicato. In questo tipo di allenamento non è possibile basare l'intensità sulla frequenza cardiaca poiché il ritardo nell'aumento dei battiti non permette di verificare la correttezza dell'impegno. Essendo comunque massimali non si pone il problema e se non si dispone di un powermeter ci si basa su una percezione su scala RPE da 1 a 10 a circa 8-9.

Resistance during the Prep Phase: Fairly light weights to enable you to adopt and maintain correct form throughout. If your muscles burn at the end of a set then you are lifting too heavy for this phase. Perform strength and conditioning once or twice each week. Avoid the ‘no pain, no gain’ thinking. Strength will compliment your training making you more powerful, less prone to injury and help you focus on range of movement required for all three disciplines. It should not inhibit your subsequent workouts.","0","","","","","0.659359455108643","0","","","","77","108","","","0.540110430841404","21.09","0","0","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aim for the equivalent of an energy gel every 30 minutes for training. It doesn't even have to be an ""energy"" product. You could have a cereal bar, a banana, a sugary drink or whatever you like. It just needs to consist mainly of carbohydrate.

"FD - Forza Dinamica - fuori sella ( 3 serie)","Bike","Le Ripetizioni di forza Dinamica (FD) Servono per abituare l'organismo a sforzi violenti a partire da diverse condizioni (pianura, salita, rapporto agile e rapporto duro). L'analisi dei tracciati di gara ha mostrato che anche in gare considerate performance ad intensità costante, come le cronometro, in realtà sono costellate da una moltitudine di brevi impulsi ad alto impegno di forza (in gare lunghe tipo IM e GF si sono contati fino a 200 di questi episodi!!). Non allenare queste espressioni di forza significa trovarsi in una condizione sfavorevole nel fine gara che impedisce di finalizzare una gara di ciclismo o di correre al meglio la maratona, nel caso dell'Ironman. La parte centrale dell'allenamento è costituita da tre serie costituite da 5 ripetizioni da 10"", ad ogni ripetizione si recupera 1', mentre al termine di ogni serie si recupera 3'. Le ripetute vanno eseguite in piedi suoi pedali. Come se eseguono: L'esecuzione prevede che si raggiungano le massime RPM e di conseguenza la massima potenzza consentite dal rapporto indicato, nel tempo indicato. In questo tipo di allenamento non è possibile basare l'intensità sulla frequenza cardiaca poiché il ritardo nell'aumento dei battiti non permette di verificare la correttezza dell'impegno. Essendo comunque massimali non si pone il problema e se non si dispone di un powermeter ci si basa su una percezione su scala RPE da 1 a 10 a circa 8-9.

Form is key, reduce the intensity if you cannot hold your form. Resistance during the Build Phase: The most strength gains are made during this phase. Progress intensity by adding resistance only if you are able to maintain correct form throughout. Sets should feel more challenging, however be cautious of negatively impacting your following workouts. Perform strength and conditioning once or twice each week. Avoid the ‘no pain, no gain’ thinking. Strength will compliment your training making you more powerful, less prone to injury and help you focus on range of movement required for all three disciplines. It should not inhibit your subsequent workouts.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Just make sure that your group workouts replace similar types of workouts from your training plan. For example, you might swap solo speed work for a group/coached session.
